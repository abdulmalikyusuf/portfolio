                  I bring harmony to the intersection of visual design and frontend
                  architecture, translating creative direction into performant, scalable

                  usability.

              With over four years of experience in frontend development, I specialize in
              building responsive websites and web applications that prioritize

              . My core tools include React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and I'm
              passionate about leveraging these technologies to create fast, modern
              interfaces that scale with business needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive in a collaborative environment, working closely with designers to
              bring UI concepts to life and with backend engineers to ensure seamless
              integration across the stack. Whether Iâ€™m refining micro-interactions,
              implementing reusable components, or translating complex Figma layouts into
              clean code, I aim to strike the right balance between aesthetics and
              functionality.

              From landing pages to complex dashboards, I bring a detail-oriented mindset
              to every project. I care deeply about code quality, maintainability, and
              building experiences that users not only understand but enjoy. My goal is
              always to deliver frontend solutions that are intuitive, scalable, and
              aligned with the bigger product vision.
